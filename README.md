## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Yan Gabriel but you can just call me Yan or Grygo if you want!
Im currently 19 and i've been studying programation since 2021. My first contact with studying IT was in college and since then i realized how wonderfull programation can be.

ðŸŒ± Knowledges: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Python.
