### My name is Yan Gabriel but you can just call me Yan, Gabriel or Grygoryn if you want!
Im currently 19 and i've been studying programation since 2021. My first contact with studying IT was in college and since then i realized how wonderfull programation can be. For the whole last year i studied programation logic and python in my freetime, but just recently i started focusing more on it and having project ideas.
